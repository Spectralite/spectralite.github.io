# Test review
Overall the test wasn't as hard as I presupposed it to be, I had scoured the internet for inklings into its nature and the closest i came to was it being an "iq test" of sorts. Upon reflection however , the test was more of a riddle similar to the "One Percent Club" (those of you in the UK will know what that is.)
Overall if i had prepared beforehand using riddles and questions of that sort I think I would have done much better
I think i crushed the numerical section (literally just GCSE Maths with a calculator), and done mediocre on the riddle side(though I must say I am burning to find out some of the answers)

The language section of finding two words which were synonyms or gradients lower was a bit tricky as I simply hadn't encountered many of those words before but I think it went alright.

Oh yeah, the first section was one of finding diagrams where they matched the configuration of the given diagram with respect to the position of a point or *. That I crushed.

Hopefully it was enough for me to secure a place, least of my straight predicted 9s hopefully providing a big boost along with my socioeconomic status
